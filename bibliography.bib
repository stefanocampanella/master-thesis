The in-depth focus on applications separates this book from others, and helps students to see how linear algebra can be applied to real-life situations. Some of the more contemporary topics of applied linear algebra are included here which are not normally found in undergraduate textbooks. Theoretical developments are always accompanied with detailed examples, and each section ends with a number of exercises from which students can gain further insight. Moreover, the inclusion of historical information provides personal insights into the mathematicians who developed this subject. The textbook contains numerous examples and exercises, historical notes, and comments on numerical performance and the possible pitfalls of algorithms. Solutions to all of the exercises are provided, as well as a {CD}-{ROM} containing a searchable copy of the textbook.},

	shorttitle = {Concrete Mathematics},
	abstract = {This book introduces the mathematics that supports advanced computer programming and the analysis of algorithms. The primary aim of its well-known authors is to provide a solid and relevant base of mathematical skills - the skills needed to solve complex problems, to evaluate horrendous sums, and to discover subtle patterns in data. It is an indispensable text and reference not only for computer scientists - the authors themselves rely heavily on it! - but for serious users of mathematics in virtually every discipline. Concrete Mathematics is a blending of {CONtinuous} and {disCRETE} mathematics. "More concretely," the authors explain, "it is the controlled manipulation of mathematical formulas, using a collection of techniques for solving problems." The subject matter is primarily an expansion of the Mathematical Preliminaries section in Knuth's classic Art of Computer Programming, but the style of presentation is more leisurely, and individual topics are covered more deeply. Several new topics have been added, and the most significant ideas have been traced to their historical roots. The book includes more than 500 exercises, divided into six categories.Complete answers are provided for all exercises, except research problems, making the book particularly valuable for self-study. Major topics include: *Sums *Recurrences *Integer functions *Elementary number theory *Binomial coefficients *Generating functions *Discrete probability *Asymptotic methods  This second edition includes important new material about mechanical summation. In response to the widespread use of the first edition as a reference book, the bibliography and index have also been expanded, and additional nontrivial improvements can be found on almost every page. Readers will appreciate the informal style of Concrete Mathematics. Particularly enjoyable are the marginal graffiti contributed by students who have taken courses based on this material. The authors want to convey not only the importance of the techniques presented, but some of the fun in learning and using them. 0201558025B04062001},

	abstract = {The statistics of natural catastrophes contains very counter-intuitive results. Using earthquakes as a working example, we show that the energy radiated by such events follows a power-law or Pareto distribution. This means, in theory, that the expected value of the energy does not exist (is infinite), and in practice, that the mean of a finite set of data in not representative of the full population. Also, the distribution presents scale invariance, which implies that it is not possible to define a characteristic scale for the energy. A simple model to account for this peculiar statistics is a branching process: the activation or slip of a fault segment can trigger other segments to slip, with a certain probability, and so on. Although not recognized initially by seismologists, this is a particular case of the stochastic process studied by Galton and Watson one hundred years in advance, in order to model the extinction of (prominent) families. Using the formalism of probability generating functions we will be able to derive, in an accessible way, the main properties of these models. Remarkably, a power-law distribution of energies is only recovered in a very special case, when the branching process is at the onset of attenuation and intensification, i.e., at criticality. In order to account for this fact, we introduce the self-organized critical models, in which, by means of some feedback mechanism, the critical state becomes an attractor in the evolution of such systems. Analogies with statistical physics are drawn. The bulk of the material presented here is self-contained, as only elementary probability and mathematics are needed to start to read.},

It is a cornerstone of the theory of spatial stochastic processes with applications in such fields as statistical physics, epidemiology, and the spread of populations. Percolation plays a pivotal role in studying more complex systems exhibiting phase transition. The mathematical theory is mature, but continues to give rise to problems of special beauty and difficulty. The emphasis of this book is upon core mathematical material and the presentation of the shortest and most accessible proofs. The book is intended for graduate students and researchers in probability and mathematical physics. Almost no specialist knowledge is assumed beyond undergraduate analysis and probability. This new volume differs substantially from the first edition through the inclusion of much new material, including: the rigorous theory of dynamic and static renormalization; a sketch of the lace expansion and mean field theory; the uniqueness of the infinite cluster; strict inequalities between critical probabilities; several essays on related fields and applications; numerous other results of significant. There is a summary of the hypotheses of conformal invariance. A principal feature of the process is the phase transition. The subcritical and supercritical phases are studied in detail. There is a guide for mathematicians to the physical theory of scaling and critical exponents, together with selected material describing the current state of the rigorous theory. To derive a rigorous theory of the phase transition remains an outstanding and beautiful problem of mathematics.},

This book provides the reader with comprehensive basic knowledge of Lévy processes, and at the same time introduces stochastic processes in general. No specialist knowledge is assumed and proofs and exercises are given in detail. The author systematically studies stable and semi-stable processes and emphasizes the correspondence between Lévy processes and infinitely divisible distributions. All serious students of random phenomena will benefit from this volume.},
